## Public Restroom Mapping Project

####Part 1: Finding location data for public restrooms in New York

First, I performed some data wrangling to link information about public toilets to latitude and longitude coordinates.

1) I found a json of all the public toilets in the city making a request here: 

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/hjae-yuav.json?$$app_token=hpyz6OCeHJNRoyNO2KFT3iQKE
(webpage: http://dev.socrata.com/foundry/#/data.cityofnewyork.us/hjae-yuav)
(webpage: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Recreation/Directory-Of-Toilets-In-Public-Parks/hjae-yuav)

2) Using the Google Geocoding API I matched the toilet location and borough to latitude and longitude coordinates, as well as place_id. I created a new json file based on this data.
